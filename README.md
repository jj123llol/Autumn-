Autumn members and mods made fun of someone asking if they supported a function,
when met with proof of them not supporting it, they deleted it!
dont be like Autumn, when somethings broken fix it instead of covering up your flaws.

This is sad to see from an executor who wants to raise their price, my server member just wanted to ask them to support a function for me, and they met that with belittling when the issue was on their end.
